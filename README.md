GL-CS
=====

GL-CS is a little project where I'm going to try and make a system for reading in the Khronos gl.xml spec and generating C# wrapper classes for each of the versions and profiles (plus extensions). The goal being a simple way to generate a very C-like wrapper on top of OpenGL for use (primarily, though not exclusively) with SDL2#.

At this point consider the project a toy unfit for any real use. Feel free to help contribute if you have experience either in parsing the gl.xml spec or in generating C# wrappers for OpenGL.

GL-CS is available under the zlib License.
